### Week 2: Design

During this phase, your team will create the visual design for your website, including layout, color scheme, typography, and imagery. You may use wireframes, mockups, or other design tools to create a visual representation of the website.

### **Action Items:**

1. **During the team meetings :** 
    
    **Conduct research**
    - Gather inspiration from other websites and brands that have a similar style or target audience. Analyze their design choices, color schemes, and typography to help guide your team's decisions.
    
    **Create wireframes**
    - Create wireframes that outline the basic layout and structure of the website. This will help you get a sense of the hierarchy of content and how users will navigate the site.
    - A wireframe is a simple visual representation of the layout and structure of a website, app, or other digital product. It is used in the early stages of the design process to help designers and stakeholders visualize and iterate on the product's overall layout and functionality. Wireframes are low-fidelity designs that focus on the user experience and information architecture, without being distracted by details such as colors, typography, and images. Once the wireframe is finalized, it serves as a blueprint for the design and development of the product. You can use Figma, another drawing tool or just pen and paper to create the wireframe.
    
    **Choose a color scheme**
    - Based on your research and brand guidelines, choose a color scheme for the website. Consider how the colors will work together, and how they will impact the user experience.
    
    **Select typography**
    -Choose a set of fonts that will be used consistently throughout the website. Consider legibility, readability, and how the fonts will work with the overall design.
    
2. **Through asynchronous team work :**  
    
    **Create mockups**
    - Using the wireframes as a guide, create high-fidelity mockups of the website. This will give you a better sense of how the design will look and feel, and allow you to make more detailed design decisions.
    - Create a project on Figma (Team Leader)
    - Invite all team members, the instructor, and the mentor to the Figma project with edit permissions.
    
    **Request feedback and approval from the instructor**
    - Ask the instructor to review the design and provide any necessary feedback or suggestions before starting to build your website.
    - Once you have received approval from the instructor, you can proceed with developing your website or app based on the design.
