<!-- 1. **Create the “To Do” items and assign to team members during your regular zoom calls.**

      Search and/or filter function(s).

   What features are optional?

<!-- 3. **Choose an API (Application Programming Interface):**

      - Consider the following when choosing an API:

         What data does the API provide?
         How well-documented is the API?
         Is the API easy to use?
         Is the API free or paid?

      - Here is a list of available APIs that you may consider utilising for your project.
